# cp1-calculator

In my first year, as part of the "Computer Programming 1" course, I worked on developing a calculator application using the Java programming language. This project was designed as an application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. The application supports 
fundamental mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced functions, and includes error handling mechanisms. Through this project, I enhanced my proficiency in Java and improved my problem-solving skills in 
software development.
